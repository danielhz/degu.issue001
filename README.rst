This addon reproduce an issue that I first documented in the Plone forum at
https://community.plone.org/t/dexterity-content-types-does-not-appear-in-the-portal-globalnav/849

To reproduce this issue you must:

1. Run bootstrap/buildout.
2. Create a new plone site activating the add-ons:
   - plone.app.multilingual
   - danielhz.issue001
3. Go to "Site Setup" > "Multilingual Settings" and set two languages.
   I set English and EspaÃ±ol.
4. Create a new Task "Task" inside "/en/"
5. Create a new TaskFolder "Task folder" inside "/en/"

After these steps, the elements "Task" and "Task folder" does not appear in
the portal.globalnav.
